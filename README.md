I would like to make a non-functional display only clone of the Google Homepage.
I would like to do it with only CSS and HTML.
Once I have completed it, I would like to be very familiar with CSS/HTML such as:
1. How to move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the botton or top of the page
...and others
